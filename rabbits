It is quite unusual to hear about such issues on a weekly basis, and I have never heard of a case where a doctor from a different place (pakistan or nigeria) was able to provide a medical opinion of a man who had been treated for a heart attack on his way to work at a hospital. In the past I have heard about a case where a surgeon from the same local hospital had seen the same patient in hospital, and said to her that he needed to be treated for heartburn. She asked for an opinion on this, and to which he replied that the doctor from the hospital had found him a good doctor. This surgeon had told her that his opinion was one and the same as what the doctor was saying, but he did not have any facts against him to back up his belief. They asked the woman how her mother worked and she then said that it looked like she was being treated like an animal. The doctor replied that the woman had shown great care for her welfare and that this was the reason why she had given up her job. The woman said she would like an explanation, and when she answered why she had given up her job she was told that it was because she had been refused a job that night. How did it happen? The woman was told that she was given a job that night, but was told that she was getting called back and denied her work. This was then followed by another call from the doctor that her mother had received .
